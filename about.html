						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis work passions ocellated between professional photography & web development. In the photo realm, he has taken photos of hundreds of weddings and worked for thousands of commercial clients. He is fluent with Photoshop, Capture One and a variety of other photo manipulation tools, even when sleeping. In the Web realm he is a full stack web developer with skills not only in the usual languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript… But he’s also useful with a variety of other technologies including Jquery, Wordpress, Mongo DB, Moment JS, Node JS, MySQL, Ajax, API usage, Firebase, Angular and React.<br><br>

						So let's Git to the nitty-gritty… <br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFavorite movie? Nacho libre.<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFavorite vacation place ever? Maui.<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFavorite place to ski? That’s a tough one, it’s either Mammoth Mountain California or Park City Utah.<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPC vs Mac? Doesn’t matter, they’re both just tools<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCanon vs Nikon? Likewise, doesn’t matter they’re just tools.<br>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChocolate vs vanilla? Now that’s a little harder. Scott will go through phases and which one is definitely more desirable than the other. So that will have to be a tie. Usually the dealbreaker is sprinkles, Although sprinkle should go on vanilla ice cream not chocolate.<br><br>

						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCertifications? Yes, he is certified to have 2 children as long as neither child is older than 15 years old. He will need to get recertified next year as both of his children become a year older :-)  
						He also has a couple college degrees, professional affiliations and certifications.
